# Larasvelte Starter Kit by Ose Ughu

This repository is a Laravel + Inertia + Svelte 5 + Progressive Web App (PWA) Starter Kit designed to help you kickstart your web application development. It integrates modern tools like SQLite, Bun, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN UI to provide a fully functional foundation for building reactive and scalable web applications.

Key Features
â€¢ Laravel + Inertia: A robust backend combined with a reactive front end.
â€¢ Svelte 5: Utilises the latest version of Svelte for seamless front-end interactivity.
â€¢ Progressive Web App (PWA): Configured to work offline and feel like a native app.
â€¢ Bun: Ultra-fast JavaScript runtime for bundling and running your front-end assets.
â€¢ TailwindCSS: Rapid UI development with utility-first CSS.
â€¢ ShadCN UI: Modern and accessible UI components out of the box.
â€¢ Subdomain Routing: Includes an example configuration in RouteServiceProvider with additional routes in routes/admin.php.

Subdomain Routing Example

The codebase includes an example of subdomain routing configured in the RouteServiceProvider. The subdomain routing example is specifically for an admin panel and uses routes/admin.php.

If subdomain routing is not required for your project, you can remove it by either:

1. Commenting out or deleting the configuration in the RouteServiceProvider. \
2. Removing the routes/admin.php file.
